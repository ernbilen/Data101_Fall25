**Where do data come from?**

&rarr;&nbsp; from **a unit** or **object** is an item we observe. When the unit is a person, we call the unit as a **subject**. (cars, plants, Dickinson students..)

--

&rarr;&nbsp; the information we record is called an **observation**. (Like, age)

--

&rarr;&nbsp; if we record all observations and store it together, we have a **variable**. (Like, age can vary from person to person)

--

&rarr;&nbsp; if we put bunch of variables together, we have a **dataset**. Data sets look like tables or spreadsheets.

--

&rarr;&nbsp; if we put bunch of data sets together, we have a **database**. (we won't work with databases in this class, but know that most companies and organizations work databases because of how much data they have)

How to go about collecting data? If you collect it from the entire population, ie, every object or member of the group: **census**. (super costly)

--

&rarr;&nbsp; Luckily we don't need to, due to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

--

CLT says: if you collect data from a random subset from the population, the implications you can derive from your sample will be roughly the same as if you access to the entire population! (getting a sample is easier, but not a walk in the park either, eg: political polls)

**Variable Types**

→ **Categorical (qualitative)** variables are those which classify the units into categories. The categories may or may not have a natural ordering to them.

Example: Education level (high-school, college,…)

→ A **numeric (quantitative)** variable is one that measures a numerical characteristic.

Example: Years of education, income

--

What do you think?: eye color
--
, number of words in a book
--
, hometown
--
, zipcode

--

Precision of recording:<br>
A **discrete variable** can only consist of integer values, 
	e.g., N = {1, 2, 3, …}
	
A **continuous variable** can take on any value within a given interval. e.g., 1.5088039, 5, 693.84975 …

--

What do you think? Number of elevators in a building
--
, IMDB score
--
, duration of a speech

**Activity:**

→ Suppose you are studying Shakespeare plays. You want to collect data to answer some research questions.

Come up with **three variables** you could record.

-How you would measure it (be specific).<br>
-Identify whether it is numerical, categorical.<br>
-If numerical, is it discrete or continuous?<br>
-Note any possible measurement issues.

```{r,echo=F, out.width="48%",out.extra='style="margin-top:-150px;margin-left:400px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("shakespeare.png")
```

**Activity:**

→ Let's repeat the previous activity, but this time with Johann Sebastian Bach's works.

Come up with **three variables** you could record.

-How you would measure it (be specific).<br>
-Identify whether it is numerical, categorical.<br>
-If numerical, is it discrete or continuous?<br>
-Note any possible measurement issues.

```{r,echo=F, out.width="48%",out.extra='style="margin-top:-150px;margin-left:400px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("bach.png")
```

**Dataframes**

In python and R, datasets are often representated as **dataframes**. Dataframes are objects in your programming session that hold your dataset in a table-like form.

Examples:

[Titanic data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aliaamiri/titanic-passengers-and-crew-complete-list?utm_source=chatgpt.com) ([dashboard](https://reporttitanic.streamlit.app))

[Enrollment dashboard at Dickinson](https://enrollment.streamlit.app)

**Statistical summaries from data**

Measures of Central Tendency <br>
-Mean: Arithmetic average, $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$ Sensitive to extremes ⚠️<br>
-Median: Middle value when sorted. Robust against outliers.<br>
-Mode: Most frequent value. Useful for categorical data.<br>

```{r,echo=F, out.width="60%",out.extra='style="margin-top:10px;margin-left:-20px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("titanicage.png")
```

```{r, echo=F, out.width="45%", out.extra='style="position:relative; top:-400px; left:450px; z-index:10;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("meanmedian.png")
```

**Activity**

Suppose we want to know about class sizes at Dickinson. We sampled 7 classes:

| Course    | Enrollment | Subject       |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| DATA 101  | 11         | Data Analytics|
| MATH 225  | 24         | Math          |
| HIST 206  | 7          | History       |
| INBM 236  | 25         | Business      |
| ECON 101  | 24         | Economics     |
| ECON 214  | 18         | Economics     |
| ECON 351  | 24         | Economics     |

<br>
-Find mean and median of `Enrollment`.<br>
-Find the mode of `Subject`.

**Statistical summaries from data**

Measures of Spread (Variability) <br>
-Range = Max - Min. Very sensitive to extremes. ⚠️<br>
-Variance: Average squared deviation from the mean.<br>
-Standard Deviation (SD): Square root of variance; to get back the original units.

<div style="display:flex; align-items:center; gap:24px;">

  <!-- make the image column take ~70% of the slide -->
  <div style="flex:0 0 70%;">

  </div>

<div style="flex:0 0 30%; font-size:110%; margin-top:-100px;">
  
sample variance:
$$
s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}
$$

sample std dev:
$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}
